After installing Git you may want to change

0:00:02.860,0:00:04.600
some of your profile settings.

0:00:05.080,0:00:08.520
Most of the time they are in the home directory in the ".profile" file

0:00:08.520,0:00:11.640
or any similar file that your shell is using.

0:00:11.640,0:00:12.960
Heres an example:

0:00:13.380,0:00:18.140
First environment variable is setting the language for Git messages

0:00:18.400,0:00:21.420
One can use LC_MESSAGES or LANGUAGE.

0:00:21.420,0:00:23.420
I've set mine to english.

0:00:23.660,0:00:27.340
The rest of this file contains command line settings.

0:00:27.340,0:00:31.420
You can, of course, skip it if you want to start working with Git immediately.

0:00:31.680,0:00:34.140
This script [git-completion.bash] mostly runs as a part of a Git install

0:00:34.140,0:00:36.560
and sets the autocompletion for the Git console commands.

0:00:37.160,0:00:40.780
I have it here, and you, most likely, will have it in some other location.

0:00:40.780,0:00:43.800
But even if you don't have it, you can download it from here.

0:00:43.800,0:00:46.660
And this script "git-prompt.sh" is in the same place

0:00:46.700,0:00:51.260
and it contains a git_ps1 function that allows us to add various useful info

0:00:51.260,0:00:54.640
about the state of the Git project to the command prompt

0:00:54.640,0:00:56.640
These 2 environment variables
[GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=true GIT_PS!_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES=true]

0:00:56.640,0:01:00.920
are not mandatory, but they are also declared and used in this file.

0:01:01.840,0:01:04.300
These are the most basic settings.

0:01:04.300,0:01:06.240
There are plenty of other,

0:01:06.240,0:01:09.480
way more powerful scripts for efficient command line and Git integration,

0:01:09.480,0:01:11.480
written by 3rd party developers.

0:01:11.480,0:01:13.480
They are easy to find,

0:01:13.480,0:01:18.240
just google "Git prompt" and your shell name

0:01:18.420,0:01:22.340
like bash or zsh or any other

0:01:22.340,0:01:24.620
And you will see dozens of results.

0:01:24.820,0:01:30.040
But you may not want to spend your time on that right now. First, watch the screencast and get a better understanding of Git.

0:01:30.080,0:01:34.540
Right after that I highly recommend that you install this kind of script as it can be extremely helpful.

0:01:34.540,0:01:37.820
In this screencast I use a bash script

0:01:37.820,0:01:39.380
that you can find here [https://github.magicmonty/bash-git-prompt]

0:01:39.380,0:01:42.760
but most of the time all the scripts are quite similar,

0:01:42.780,0:01:46.600
therefore pick the one you like, whichever fits you best.
